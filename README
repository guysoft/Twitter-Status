How to install pidgin-twitter-status

Introduction
------------

Requirements:

Pidgin, Perl and the following two Perl modules, which you may have to install manually:

    * XML::RSS
    * LWP::Simple 

Details
-------
Is Pidgin Perl enabled?

In Pidgin, navigate to Help->About and find Perl: Enabled If Perl is not enabled, you may have to install Perl and then re-install Pidgin.
Install XML::RSS and LWP::Simple

This depends on your operating system, but could be as simple as

# cpan XML::RSS
# cpan LWP::Simple

If your OS or Perl installation uses a package system it's recommended you install the modules using that, if possible.

Using Pidgin, navigate to Tools -> Plugins and find Twitter Status. Enable it, and click the Configure Plugin button to open the plugin configuration dialog. Enter your Twitter RSS user feed (locate it on your twitter user page, you might need to switch to oldtwitter to find it), configure other options, and click Close.
